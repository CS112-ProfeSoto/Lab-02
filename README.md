# **Lab 2 - Revising History + Inheritance**

White supremacy takes various shapes outside of white pointy hats and flaming crosses that come to mind. One of those forms is the misinterpretation, misrepresentation, and outright disinformation in history. In the age of information we live, it is our responsibility to correct and revise that misinterpretation by spreading knowledge that may not have been accessible to everyone.

For example, the Watchmen series on HBO brought light to the Tulsa Massacre of 1921 that many had never heard about, even people that grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Here is how May 31, 1921 was often told:

 

As recent as 2016, eyewitness testimony has been [discovered] (https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/long-lost-manuscript-contains-searing-eyewitness-account-tulsa-race-massacre-1921-180959251/). In 2019, mass graves in Tulsa have been [discovered] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/12/16/tulsa-moves-closer-learning-if-there-are-mass-graves-race-massacre/). Instead, we could teach about this event in US history with the following project.

 

# Lab project:

Create the `HistoricalEvent` class and extend `RevisedHistoricalEvent` from it, adding on the instance variables and methods shown below in the UML diagram:

![UML diagrams of classes described below](https://i.imgur.com/yw1q5W0.png) 

Remember that `...` in the UML diagram represents _all_ of the required methods (constructors, setters, getters, `toString`, `equals`). You should add instance variables for a revised description and citation, as well as a `teach` method that will print out the information as the second screenshot above. You can test with the provided `main` method, and will add your own `RevisedHistoricalEvent`.
Sample output of what `teach()` method does:

HISTORICAL EVENT EXAMPLE:
====================================================
On 5/31/1921: A black teenager, who was working as a shoe shiner in downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma, was arrested and accused of assaulting a white woman on a public elevator in broad daylight. A group of white vigilantes, intent on lynching him, and armed black men intent on protecting him gathered at the courthouse. A shot rang out, and the violence began. The riot resulted in 35 square blocks of destruction, including more than 1,250 homes, churches, schools, businesses, a hospital, and a library.5/31/1921

====================================================
REVISED HISTORICAL EVENT EXAMPLE:
====================================================
The following  "history" was told for many years:

A black teenager, who was working as a shoe shiner in downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma, was arrested and accused of assaulting a white woman on a public elevator in broad daylight. A group of white vigilantes, intent on lynching him, and armed black men intent on protecting him gathered at the courthouse. A shot rang out, and the violence began. The riot resulted in 35 square blocks of destruction, including more than 1,250 homes, churches, schools, businesses, a hospital, and a library.


By correcting history, not just rewriting it, we are revising it to embark on the process of righting a wrong. 
Here is the revised history:
It started with newspaper reports that a black man had assaulted a white elevator operator. He was arrested, and black World War I vets rushed to the courthouse to prevent a lynching. Whites were deputized and handed weapons, the shooting started and then it got out of hand. It was mob rule for two days, and the result was the complete devastation of the entire black community. The white mobs looted the homes and businesses before they set fire to the community. Planes circled mid-air and bombed what was known as Black Wall Street. The National Guard was called out after the governor declared martial law, and imprisoned all blacks that were not already in jail. More than 35 blocks were destroyed, along with more than 1,200 homes, and some 300 people died, mostly Blacks.

You are provided, and should go over all the code for:

- `Date.java`: represents a `Date` object, used for composition object in `HistoricalEvent` class
- `Main.java`: driver program that contains Tulsa Riot/Massacre information to build `HistoricalEvent` and `RevisedHistoricalEvent` objects

# To-Do Checklist (in the recommended order):

1. Implement `HistoricalEvent` class with required instance variables and all required methods for encapsulation (model class) 
2. Implement `RevisedHistoricalEvent` class to derive from `HistoricalEvent`, implementing all required methods as well as the `teach` method described above
3. Create your own `RevisedHistoricalEvent` object in the driver (`main` method in `Main.java`) for a historical event you are familiar with or have researched that needs revision. Make sure to provide a reputable (academic) resource.

# Tips:

- You're going to get errors in the `main` method until you create the `HistoricalEvent` and `RevisedHistoricalEvent` classes. Comment out those lines! As you get things working (ex: finished `HistoricalEvent`), you can uncomment those lines that were giving you an error.
- Not sure if certain methods are working? Feel free to add more code to test your methods as well!
- Don't forget to deep copy instance variables! Be strategic, where would that make the most sense?
- Make sure you use the `@Override` flag above the method definitions you're overriding (`toString` and `equals`)
- On that note, make sure you're overriding `equals` method correctly!
- Make sure you build `HistoricalEvent` first, that way you can reuse any of those methods to implement parts of `RevisedHistoricalEvent`
- Notice the difference in details and language between the examples above. Words like riot distract and shift the blame from one group to the other. Specific details, from a reputable source, help to disambiguate perception of events. As always, pay attention to detail, our words are powerful.
